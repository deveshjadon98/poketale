Go to dist directory and open index.html using your choice of browser.
- At first you'll see pokemin species list as shown in screenshots/species_list.png.
- You can also load more results on clicking load more button, present at the bottom. 
- On clicking Evolution chain you'll be shown the evolution chain for the selected pokemon as shown in evolutions_list.png.
- You can go back to pakemon species list view by clicking on All Species button.
- Addedd the UI for search but it is not functional yet. 
- Another feature that I am looking to add is to make this app easily accessible for everyone by making it more accessible for screen readers.
